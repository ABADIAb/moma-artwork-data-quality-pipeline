# MOMA Artwork Data Quality Pipeline 🎨📊

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **Data Quality and Machine Learning pipeline** applied to the **Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)** dataset. The primary objective was to quantify the impact of data quality dimensions (completeness, consistency, accuracy) on predictive model performance.

We successfully demonstrated the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" principle: rigorous data cleaning improved the **Random Forest classification accuracy by ~27%** (from 0.667 on dirty data to 0.847 on clean data), pushing the model to state-of-the-art performance for this task.

## 👥 Team & Credits
Developed as a group project for the Data Quality course at **Politecnico di Milano**.
* **Team Members:** Sebastian Ballesteros, Alberto Capoti, **Felipe Abadia Bermeo**.

### 🧬 My Contribution
* **Data Transformation Logic:** Designed the algorithms to standardize heterogeneous measurement formats (dimensions in strings) and date parsing.
* **Error Detection:** Implemented rule-based validation for semantic inconsistencies (e.g., *Artist Death Date < Birth Date* or *Artwork Date > Artist Death*).
* **Preprocessing Strategy:** Engineered the feature scaling and encoding pipeline used for the analysis phase.

## 🚀 Key Results
We tested four classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost) on both "Dirty" and "Clean" datasets to predict the Artwork's Department.

| Model | Accuracy (Dirty Data) | Accuracy (Clean Data) | Impact |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Random Forest** | **0.667** | **0.847** | **+27.0%** 🚀 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.475 | 0.565 | +18.9% |

> **Insight:** While Random Forest was robust even on dirty data, the data quality pipeline unlocked its full potential, achieving an impressive 84.7% accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **Data Engineering:** Pandas (Advanced Indexing), NumPy.
* **Data Quality:** YData Profiling (Audit), Recordlinkage (Entity Resolution).
